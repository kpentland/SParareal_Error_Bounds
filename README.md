# Error bound analysis of the stochastic parareal algorithm

This repository contains sample code for the pre-print by Pentland, Tamborrino, and Sullivan - "Error bound analysis of the stochastic parareal algorithm" (http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05496). Using the MATLAB scripts in each folder, one should be able to re-create the numerical results from the paper.
